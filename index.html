  <p>SnapPortal is a civic issue reporting platform that empowers citizens to report problems in their community — such as potholes,
    water leaks, broken streetlights, and more — by simply snapping a photo and uploading it.</p>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About SnapPortal</h2>
  <p>SnapPortal</strong> is more than just a website — it's a <em>civic empowerment initiative</em> developed by a team of engineering students passionate about creating real-world impact.
    Our aim is to give a voice to the often unheard and overlooked citizens by offering them a simple, effective way to report local civic issues.</p>
    <p>
      Whether it's a pothole damaging vehicles, a broken streetlight causing safety concerns, or uncollected waste posing health risks —
      SnapPortal enables individuals to upload photographic evidence of these problems directly to a centralized platform where they can be seen and acte upon.
